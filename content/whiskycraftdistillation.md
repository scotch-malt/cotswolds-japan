### DISTILLATION 
On day 5, we’re ready to start distilling and the first step in our double distillation process is the wash still – otherwise known as Mary. She’s a 2500-litre copper pot still, made for us by Forsyths in Rothes. By boiling the fermented wash for several hours we can collect the Low Wines; liquid containing all the alcohol and flavour compounds from the wash.

We then need to pick out the best bits from the Low Wines – only these will make it into the spirit and become whisky. To do this, we distil the Low Wines in the second still: our 1600-litre spirit still, Janis. The first liquid to run off the stills is the harsh ‘foreshots’, which are set aside. These are followed by the ‘heart’ of the run – our future whisky, which is collected for only a couple of hours before the spirit flowing off the still becomes heavier and oilier. This is the final section, called the ‘feints’ and this is also set aside.

Our cut points (the moment we switch from foreshots > hearts > feints) are also quite unusual. The fruity esters created during fermentation will appear very early on in the distillation, so in order to capture them in our spirit we make sure we switch from foreshots to hearts after only a few minutes. The cut to feints also happens sooner than it usually would – this means that none of the heavier, rougher compounds that come through towards the end will make it into our spirit.
