### Lovingly crafted 
We start with our Cotswolds Dry Gin. Distilled to 83% ABV, we dilute it to 65% ABV for casking – just the right strength to extract fantastic flavour and colour from the wood without drawing out the harsher notes. It goes into the same casks as our flagship Single Malt Whisky – first-fill ex-Bourbon barrels and shaved, toasted and recharred red wine casks, where it matures for three months. We then add fresh sweet Valencian orange peel to the matured gin, and candied root ginger. These soak in the gin for several weeks, getting a good stir every few days. Finally, we add a touch of honey to sweeten and dilute to 46% ABV before bottling here at the distillery.

### Serving suggestions
This is a rich and warming sipping gin, perfect neat or over ice. The addition of a few drops of Angostura Bitters adds a delicious extra element, or for chillier winter evenings, try adding to warmed apple juice.
