### The finest ingredients

We add juniper, coriander and angelica to our flavourless base spirit, together with fresh orange peel, liquorice root, ground ginger, caraway and cardamom.  <br> <br>

### Tasting Notes

Sweet, woody notes from liquorice root, balanced with light spice from the ginger, zesty orange citrus and rounded off with a hint of cardamom.
