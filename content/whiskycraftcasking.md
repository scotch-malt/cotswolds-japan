### READY TO BE CASKED 
The heart cut, a colourless and fruity spirit, is known as new make spirit, and it is at 75% ABV. Thanks to our unusual fermentation and cut points it is already smooth enough to drink and full of flavour, not all that different to a grappa or eau de vie. We reduce this to 63.5% by adding demineralised water, and then it is ready to be casked. We fill the spirit into an oak cask, and then place it in the warehouse, where it will rest for a minimum of three years and one day, but potentially longer.

Over time the spirit will mellow and smooth out, and flavours and colours will be drawn out of the wood. We are filling a range of different types of cask and these will all produce different tasting whiskies. Once mature, several casks will be selected to be blended together in a batch, with each cask introducing different characteristics. The whisky is then reduced to its bottling strength of 46% and bottled here by hand at the distillery.
