### The finest ingredients

Our No.1 Wildflower Gin starts with a London Dry base featuring juniper, coriander and angelica, to which we add essences of cornflowers, lavender, orange and rhubarb root. <br> <br>

### Tasting Notes

**Nose:** Subtle floral notes reminiscent of summer meadows with fragrant orange blossom and soft piney juniper.

**Palate:** Delicate, floral notes of lavender with sweet bursts of fresh orange.

**Finish:** Refreshingly dry, clean and balanced with a lingering hint of bitter-sweet marmalade.
