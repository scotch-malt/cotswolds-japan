All about our fabulous gins
<br>
<br>
We recently launched our cask strength release single malt, Founder's Choice, aged exclusively in our founder Dan's favourite casks: shaved, toasted and re-charred American Oak red wine barriques. These uniquely active casks give a rich and intense maturation to the distillery's fruity spirit, offering toffee, oak and red fruits, and a beautiful, deep colour.
