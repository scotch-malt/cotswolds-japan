### FERMENTATION 
We run the worts off into one of our 8 steel washbacks, collecting 2,500 litres from one mash. We then add two strains of dried yeast. These were selected not just for their consistent yields but more importantly, for the excellent flavours they produce. This live yeast will turn the sugars in the worts into alcohol. We let this fermentation continue for just over 90 hours – this is considerably longer than the average fermentation length in whisky production. In the first two days of the process, the yeast works hard to produce alcohol and the wash will reach a peak of about 8% ABV. After that however, no more alcohol will be made, so most distilleries finish their fermentation there. But if left to continue for a third and fourth day, a secondary stage takes place in which the wash fills with bacteria. Although it makes it look and smell rather odd, we want this to happen – the bacteria produce acid, which combines with alcohol to form fruity flavour compounds called esters.
