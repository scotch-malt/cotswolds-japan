### Carefully sourced ingredients 
**Malt:** Odyssey, grown on Cotswolds farms and floor-malted at Warminster Maltings.

**Yeast:** Two complementary varieties - Anchor and Fermentis - to ensure good yields and excellent fruity flavours.

**Water:** Village water supply - filtered, softened and demineralised before use.

**Wood:** Shaved, toasted and re-charred 225-litre American oak red wine barriques, made for us at the cooperage in Portugal in a process designed by the late Dr Jim Swan.
