### Lovingly crafted 
Quantity matters. We put about 10x the average volume of botanicals used to make most premium gins in our copper pot still. This process creates the richest possible flavours and mouthfeel due to the high proportion of essential oils and botanical extract. These flavour-rich oils are the reason our gin goes from clear to cloudy when tonic or ice is added. The pearlescent glow, also known as a ‘louche’, happens because we choose not to chill-filter our gin to remove the oils as this would reduce the rich flavour and mouthfeel.

What do we mean by purity? It’s what we throw away that makes what we keep so special. The slower we run the stills and the more heads and tails (unpleasant beginning and end of the run) we discard, the purer the gin will taste. Our 'heart cut' is rested for 5 days to allow the flavours to marry. The only thing added before bottling is demineralised water to reduce the strength. This process, known as ‘single-shot distillation’, creates a superior gin. We never 'stretch' the batch by adding more neutral spirit (known as 'multi-shot'), so the gin we distil is the gin you drink.

### Serving suggestions
Delicious sipped over ice, this gin also stands up very well to tonic. For the perfect Cloudy G&T, fill a large balloon glass with ice, pour over a generous measure of gin, top with a splash of classic tonic water - watch the cloud appear! Garnish with a slice of pink grapefruit and a fresh bay leaf.
