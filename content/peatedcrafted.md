### Lovingly crafted 
We began making this single malt using 100% locally grown, floor-malted barley which is mashed and then fermented for more than 90 hours before a double distillation in our bespoke copper pot stills, resulting in a light and fruity new-make spirit.

After being diluted to 63.5% ABV, we then filled ex-peated quarter casks from Scotland with the new-make spirit and left these to mature, allowing the rich and fruity spirit to take on a light smoked peat flavour. The whisky has been fully matured in these casks and bottled at cask strength (59.3% ABV), non-chill filtered and with no added colouring.

### Serving suggestions
We don’t believe in rules when it comes to enjoying whisky – sip this neat, over ice, in a cocktail – however you like!
