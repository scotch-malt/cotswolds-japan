### MILLING AND MASHING 
First thing in the morning we get started grinding up the malt in our mill, so that we can extract the fuel inside it more easily. The ground-up malt, known as grist, falls directly into our 0.5 tonne mash tun where we mix it with hot water in three stages. The heat of the water triggers reactions in the malt that release its sugars into the water, turning it into worts.
