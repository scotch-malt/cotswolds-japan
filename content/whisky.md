Whisky production is at the heart of everything we do at the distillery. Our flagship Cotswolds Single Malt is a rich, fruity and sippable whisky. It has a balance and depth of flavour that belies its young age, due to the exceptional attention to detail in our distilling and our use of the finest oak casks for maturation.

We recently launched our cask strength release single malt, Founder's Choice, aged exclusively in our founder Dan's favourite casks: shaved, toasted and re-charred American Oak red wine barriques. These uniquely active casks give a rich and intense maturation to the distillery's fruity spirit, offering toffee, oak and red fruits, and a beautiful, deep colour.
