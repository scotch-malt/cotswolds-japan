### BEGIN WITH A BASE 
To make our gin, we begin with a base alcohol made from wheat. This ‘neutral grain spirit’ (supplied to us by Haymans in Essex) is at 96% ABV and is completely flavourless. It is the blank canvas that we will add flavour to through our recipe of botanicals.

### ADDING FLAVOUR
We place the neutral spirit and some water into our copper pot still, made by Arnold Holstein in Germany. It is a 500-litre pot still, but we only fill it ¾ full to make sure the vapours get plenty of contact with the copper during distillation. We then add the base botanicals (including the all-important juniper berries) and these macerate for 15 hours overnight.

In the morning, we add the rest of the botanicals to the still. We use about 10x the average weight of botanicals for a premium gin and it’s the quantity of essential oils and botanical extract from them that gives our gin its characteristic richness.

Then we begin distillation, slowly boiling the contents of the still to drive off the vapours containing all the alcohol and the flavours. The first liquid to appear is called the ‘heads’ of the run – it is quite harsh and astringent, and is discarded. The middle or ‘heart’ of the run is the only gin we will use, and we run that off the still very slowly. The final section of the run is the ‘tails’ and these are also discarded. Similarly to the cut points of our whisky, the gin heart cut happens early in the run and is relatively small – we’re just selecting the finest part of the run and avoiding any impurities. It means we only make a very small number of bottles from each run of the still, but the quality is fantastic.
