### Lovingly crafted 
To make our Old Tom Gin, we add all of the botanicals to our 50-litre Holstein still, Valerie, along with 60% ABV ‘neutral grain spirit’, a base alcohol made from wheat which is completely flavourless. We then begin distillation, collecting only the purest part of the run known as the ‘hearts’, before adding a touch of sugar syrup in keeping with traditional Old Tom recipes and filtered water to bring the final bottling down to 42% ABV.

### Serving suggestions
We enjoy our Old Tom neat, garnished with fresh orange peel, or why not try a Tom Collins cocktail by adding lemon juice, soda and sugar syrup.
