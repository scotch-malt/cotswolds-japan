### TRADITIONAL MALTING 
The harvested barley heads to the maltings at Warminster, Britain’s oldest working maltings. Using the same techniques they’ve used for hundreds of years, the maltmen steep the barley, before turning it on the malting floors by hand for several days. 100% of the malt we use is traditionally floor-malted. The final step is to kiln dry the malt and then send it up to us at the distillery.
