### Carefully sourced ingredients 
**Malt:** Odyssey. We are committed to using only barley grown in the Cotswolds, and the variety and farm on which it was grown are listed on the label of each bottle. We are one of a very small number of British whisky-makers to use 100% floor-malted barley. This comes to us from Britainâ€™s oldest working maltings, in nearby Warminster. It is unpeated.

**Yeast:** Two complementary varieties - Anchor and Fermentis - to ensure good yields and excellent fruity flavours.

**Water:** Village water supply - filtered, softened and demineralised before use.

**Wood:** Premium first-fill Kentucky ex-Bourbon 200-litre barrels and reconditioned American Oak 225-litre red wine casks that have been shaved, toasted and re-charred.

### Tasting Notes
**Nose:** Notes of honey and butterscotch layered with light fruits (peaches & apricots), a hint of marzipan.

**Palate:** Strong notes of tannin-rich malt, oils and dark sugar with lots of spice, caramelised Seville orange marmalade.

**Finish:** Long and resinous, with dark red fruits and a hint of treacle.
