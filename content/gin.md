Distilled with nine carefully considered botanicals, our Cotswolds Dry Gin is a London Dry with an aromatic twist. We distil juniper, coriander seed, angelica root, local lavender, bay leaf, hand-peeled fresh lime and pink grapefruit zest, cardamom and black peppercorn in our copper pot still, resulting in a rich and robust, award-winning gin.

We do not remove the essential oils in our gin as these create a rich flavour and mouthfeel. As a result, our gin forms a unique pearlescent cloud when ice or tonic is added, and it tastes delicious!
