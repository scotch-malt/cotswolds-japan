### Lovingly crafted 
Our Founder’s Choice release begins with our new make spirit – creamy and incredibly fruity, thanks to the pair of yeasts, 90-hour fermentation and tight heart cut on the spirit still. We dilute to 63.5% ABV for casking, and then fill the American oak STR barriques.

These brilliant casks are designed to get the absolute best from the wood and provide the perfect conditions for maturing whisky. Dr Swan’s process opens up the wood, allowing for plenty of flavour and colour to be extracted. It also builds the perfect flavours in the oak – just enough influence from the original red wine, without overpowering the new make spirit, plenty of coconut and vanilla from the American oak, and deep toffee and caramel notes from the slow toasting and intense charring steps. It’s an extremely active maturation and gives a balance, depth of flavour and rich colour normally associated with much older whiskies.

Bottled here at the distillery at natural cask strength, non-chill filtered and without any colouring.
