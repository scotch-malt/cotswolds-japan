### Lovingly crafted 
We begin making our No.1 Wildflower Gin by distilling a London Dry base which contains juniper, coriander and angelica root in our 500L Holstein still, Lorelei, taking only the purest part of the spirit run known as the ‘hearts’. We then blend the spirit with the finest essences of orange, lavender, cornflowers and rhubarb root before adding a touch of sugar syrup and filtered water to bring the final bottling down to 41.7% ABV.
