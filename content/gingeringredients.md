### Tasting Notes

**Nose:** Warm honey and sweet orange notes balance the fresh spicy ginger and piney juniper.

**Palate:** Incredibly rich and luxurious, the ginger warms everything through, with vanilla and red fruit notes from the casks.

**Finish:** A lovely long finish full of dry oak spice and ginger, with lots more honey.
