### The finest ingredients

Quality – it’s what the nine carefully selected botanicals that go into our gin all have in common. Juniper berries, coriander seed and angelica root form the classic foundation for our London Dry-style Gin. We then add Cotswolds lavender from nearby Snowshill and bay leaves. The citrus element comes from freshly-peeled lime and pink grapefruit zest - unusually we use fresh peels rather than dried because of the greater quantity of essential oils. This entails peeling several hundred limes and grapefruits per week, by hand!! The final botanicals are cardamom seed and black peppercorn, to give a hint of spice. Tough work, but totally worth it for the vibrant flavours and rich mouthfeel that make our gin stand out from the crowd. <br> <br>
